There are numerous resources available to learn about the theoretical and practical aspects of SAT.

In 2021, there was a bootcamp and several workshops related to SAT at the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu).

- [Satisfiability: Theory, Practice, and Beyond Boot Camp](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/sat-2021-bc)
- [Beyond Satisfiability](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/sat-2021-1)
- [Theoretical Foundations of SAT/SMT Solving](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/tfcs2021-sat2021-joint)
- [50 Years of Satisfiability: The Centrality of SAT in the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/sat-2021-3)

All lectures were recorded and are freely available to watch.

A nice way to get started with practical SAT solving is to watch [Armin Biere's SAT solving lectures](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/sat-solving) from the bootcamp.

It explains how to build [Satch, a SAT solver in C written from scratch](https://github.com/arminbiere/satch).
