Under the supervision of Paweł Rzążewski

#### OUTSTANDING UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AWARD

Antonin Callard (France ENS Paris-Saclay)

Thesis: Topological analysis of represented spaces and computable maps, cb0 spaces and non-countably-based spaces

Under the supervision of Mathieu Hoyrup 

### AWARDS

The annually awarded VCLA Awards are dedicated to the memory of Helmut Veith, the brilliant computer scientist who tragically passed away in March 2016, and aim to carry on his commitment to promoting young talent and promising researchers in these areas. The awardees receive:
