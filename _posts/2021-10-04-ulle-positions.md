Modern applications of AI in high-stakes domains such as health, law, or security call for solutions that can offer adequate levels of safety, accountability, transparency, responsibility, trustworthiness, and explainability. Such applications often are knowledge-intensive and depend on provably correct system behaviour. Requirements such as these necessitate the development of what in recent years have come to be known as model-based approaches to AI.

The University of Amsterdam is looking for a specialist in an area of model-based AI such as, for example, SAT solving, constraint programming, planning and scheduling, answer set programming, description logics, ontology engineering, or computer-aided verification.
