The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen invites applications for postdoctoral positions in combinatorial optimization.

The postdoc will be working in the Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group headed by Jakob Nordstrom, which is doing research on theoretical analysis of and applied algorithm development for combinatorial optimization paradigms such as SAT solving, pseudo-Boolean optimization, constraint programming, and integer linear programming. MIAO belongs to the Algorithms and Complexity Section at DIKU, one of the leading groups in theoretical computer science in Europe, which is part of an exciting environment including the [Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre](https://barc.ku.dk/), joint with the IT University of Copenhagen, and extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and Lund University on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory, but we also have a track record of start-ups and surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.

Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to Jakob Nordstrom (jn@di.ku.dk).
