The 2021 MaxSAT Evaluation (MSE 2021) is the 15th edition of MaxSAT evaluations, the primary competition-style event focusing on the evaluation of MaxSAT solvers organized yearly since 2006.
The main goals of MaxSAT Evaluation 2021 are
to assess the state of the art in the field of MaxSAT solvers,
to collect and re-distribute a heterogeneous MaxSAT benchmark set for further scientific evaluations, and
to promote MaxSAT as a viable option for solving instances of a wide range of NP-hard optimization problems.

MSE 2021 welcomes contributions of two types from the community at large:

- New MaxSAT benchmarks encoding instances of interesting NP-hard optimization problems, and
- Implementations of MaxSAT solvers that will be evaluated within MSE 2021 on a heterogeneous collection of benchmarks.

MSE 2021 is run as a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University (USA), University of Helsinki (Finland), and University of Toronto (Canada).

### Important dates

- Benchmarks submission: June 12, 2021
- Solver submission: June 15, 2021
