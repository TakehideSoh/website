    Call for Workshops for SAT 2022 -- 25th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing -- http://www.satisfiability.org

The International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints), Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning. SAT lies at the heart of the most important open problem in complexity theory (P vs NP) and underlies many applications in, among other examples, artificial intelligence, operations research, and electronic design engineering. 

We invite proposals for workshops affiliated with SAT. The purpose of the workshops is to provide an informal venue in which participants can explore specific research areas in-depth. In previous years, the workshop topics included Pragmatics of SAT, QBF, Model Counting, SMT. Workshop proposals for either these or new relevant topics are encouraged.

SAT 2022 will be part of the FLoC 2022 — [The 2022 Federated Logic Conference July 31 - August 12, 2022 Haifa, Israel](http://www.floc2022.org/)

The instructions for submission of workshop proposals below [are joint for all the conferences participating in FLoC 2022](https://floc2022.org/workshops/).

### SUBMISSION OF WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops on topics in the field of computer science, related to logic in the broad sense.
Each workshop proposal must indicate one affiliated conference of FLoC 2022.

It is strongly suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the relevant conference workshop chair before submitting a proposal.

Each proposal should consist of the following two parts.

1) A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list of previous or related workshops (if relevant). 

2) An organisational part including:

- contact information for the workshop organizers;
- proposed affiliated conference;
- estimate of the number of workshop participants (please note that small workshops, i.e., of less than ~13 participants, will likely be cancelled or merged);
- proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.);
- potential invited speakers (note that expenses of workshop invited speakers are not covered by FLoC);
- procedures for selecting papers and participants;
- plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);
- duration (which may vary from one day to two days);
- preferred period (pre or post FLoC);
- virtual/hybrid backup plans (including platform preference).

The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the hosting conferences and availability of space and facilities.

Proposals should be submitted through EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc2022workshops

Please see the Workshop Guidelines page: https://floc2022.org/workshops/ for further details and FAQ.
