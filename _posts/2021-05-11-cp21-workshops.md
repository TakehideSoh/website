The [CP conference](cp2021.a4cp.org) is the premier annual international conference on constraint programming. It is concerned with all aspects of computing with constraints, including but not limited to algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems, theory, and applications such as decision making, resource allocation, configuration, planning, and scheduling.

We invite proposals for workshops preceding the main conference program of CP 2021, which will be held online from October 25th to October 29th, 2021. The purpose of the CP workshops is to provide an informal venue in which participants can:

- explore specific research areas in depth,
- discuss new research directions,
- study specific application areas of CP, or
- bring together researchers from different fields with shared interests.

In previous years, workshop topics included data analytics, smart cities, packing & placement, cloud computing, configuration, AI planning, teaching, testing & verification, bioinformatics, constraint-based modeling, CP solvers, cross-fertilisation with other solving technologies, etc. We are happy to receive workshop proposals for either the same or new topics, especially those exploring multi-disciplinary ideas and methodologies.

While you are free to have a more traditional workshop with invited abstracts and/or invited lectures, we also encourage new ideas and formats that could foster more interaction from your audience, especially given the online context of the conference.

All workshops will take place at the site of the main conference, and follow either a half-day format or a full-day format.
