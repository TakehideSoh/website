This message is to spread the news that everybody interested can now take part in the seminars during the semester programs Satisfiability: Theory, Practice, and Beyond and Theoretical Foundations of Computer Systems running at the Simons Institute at UC Berkeley this spring.

Because of the Covid-19 pandemic these programs will be organized as virtual events, which is a bit sad, but on the bright side this opens up for much wider participation than a normal, physical semester program. Anybody who registers in advance will be able to take part in all tutorial lectures and workshops. **As a general rule, events will be held 8:30-10:30 am PST (5:30-7:30 pm CET)** to try to cater for participants in different time zones.
 
The tutorial lectures in the [Theoretical Foundations of Computer Systems Boot Camp](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/tfcs2021-boot-camp) will be held this coming week, **January 25-29**, with a pre-recorded component that participants are encouraged to watch in advance. For more information and registration, go to the boot camp web page.
 
The week after, **February 1-5**, will features the tutorials in the [Satisfiability: Theory, Practice, and Beyond Boot Camp](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/sat-2021-bc), having the same set-up with a pre-re-recorded component followed by live talks every day 8:30-10:30 am PST (5:30-7:30 pm CET). See the boot camp web page for registration and more details.

**Starting in the second week of February and lasting till early May**, there will be weekly seminars as follows (see the webpages for more details and registration):

+ Mondays: [Synthesis of Models and Systems](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/tfcs2021-1)
+ Tuesdays: [Beyond Satisfiability](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/sat-2021-1)
+ Wednesdays: [Theoretical Foundations of SAT/SMT Solving](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/tfcs2021-sat2021-joint)
+ Thursdays: [50 Years of Satisfiability: The Centrality of SAT in the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/sat-2021-3)
+ Fridays: [Games and Equilibria in System Design and Analysis](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/tfcs2021-2)
