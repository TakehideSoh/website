The conference (July 7-9) will follow a hybrid format, with in-person and virtual participation options, while the affiliated workshops will be held virtually (July 5-6).

The conference will be broadcasted from 15:00 to 20:00 (CEST). In addition, from 10:30 to 12:30 (CEST), we will organize some complementary on-site activities (panels, master classes, etc.) for people who chose the in-person option. We will decide such activities in advance with the attendees (you can make suggestions when filling in the registration form). Right now, the two invited speakers and some people with accepted papers have confirmed their physical attendance.

If you choose the on-line option, the registration is free. Anyway, you must register to get access to the conference.

If you choose the in-person option, there is a fee of 180 euros (VAT included) if you register by June 16 (AoE). The fee for late registrations is 230 euros (VAT included).
