    Scholarship for women in mathematics/computer science – Annual Deadline: November 30

 
The VCLA invites applications for the Helmut Veith Stipend from motivated and outstanding female master's students who plan to pursue one of the programs in Computer Science at TU Wien taught in English in one of the following semesters:

- winter semester 2021/2022
- summer semester 2022

### HELMUT VEITH STIPEND

The Helmut Veith Stipend is awarded annually to exceptionally talented and motivated female students in the field of computer science who pursue (or plan to pursue) one of the master's programs in Computer Science at TU Wien taught in English and have (or have the interest to develop) a solid mathematical and technical background in at least one of the areas in which Austrian scientist Helmut Veith worked. 

The Helmut Veith Stipend is dedicated to the memory of Helmut Veith (1971-2016), an outstanding computer scientist who worked in the fields of logic in computer science, computer-aided verification, software engineering, and computer security. The Helmut Veith Stipend's fund is set up by the TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology), the Wolfgang Pauli Institute, and the colleagues and friends of the late Prof. Veith.

### Award

Students who are awarded the Helmut Veith Stipend receive:

- EUR 6000 annually for a duration of up to two years.
- Waiver of all tuition fees at TU Wien.

### Eligibility

1. Applicants must be eligible for admission to one of the master's programs in computer science at TU Wien that are taught in English. In 2021/2022 those are:  

  - Logic and Computation
  - Business Informatics
  - Computer Engineering
  - Data Science
  - Media and Human-Centered Computing

1. While applications for funding can be filed before or in parallel with the admissions process, the funding will only be awarded to applicants who have been unconditionally admitted to the master's program. An application for funding does not replace the admissions process; neither does a conditional offer of funding entitle the applicant to study at TU Wien.

1. Female students who meet the following conditions are eligible to apply for the stipend:  

  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or Mathematics (Bologna first cycle) or equivalent degree
  - Extensive mathematical and technical knowledge and interest in (at least one of) Helmut Veith's areas of research:  
    - Logic in Computer Science
    - Formal Methods and Verification
    - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
    - Algorithms and Complexity Theory
    - Computer Security
  - Proficiency in English

-------------------------------------------------------------
### Conditions

- Recipients of funding must be committed to demonstrating good progress during their studies, i.e.:
-obtain at least 25 ECTS credits from the respective master's curriculum per term on average since the beginning of their master's studies (the deadlines are April 30 for the winter term and November 30 for the summer term), and
-achieve a grade average of at most 1.5.
- Recipients of funding have to reside in Austria during term time for the duration of their studies. Exceptions and temporary interruptions of the stay during term time (e.g., for internships or research visits) are subject to approval.
- The stipend is provided for the duration of the master's program (subject to the conditions listed above), for up to 2 years.

### Application Process

Students are required to submit the following documents:
- Cover Letter, describing the type of funding the student is applying for, and all other aspects the student deems relevant for the application
- Curriculum Vitae
- Motivation Letter, describing why the student wants to study in the program Logic and Computation, why funding is necessary, and with which groups of the faculty the student would be interested to work with during their master's thesis and why.
- Reports on university examinations (transcripts)
- Diplomas and/or certificates (first degree, bachelor degree, or higher). If the final academic certificate is not yet available at the time of the application deadline, a preliminary certificate (indicating the type of degree and the expected graduation date) signed and stamped by the degree-awarding university must be provided.
- Contact details of two referees (for letters of recommendation)
- English language certificate (TOEFL or similar)
- Copy of passport

A certified translation needs to be provided for documents that are not in German or English. Your application must be submitted electronically to master@logic-cs.at with the subject "Application" as a single PDF document. The name of the PDF file needs to be "document.pdf"

### Application Deadline

The annual deadline for applications is November 30.
